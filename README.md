# PomodoroClock

This project was used to learn the basics of the tkinder module within Python

The Pomodoro Technique is a focusing technique which basically states you work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break 4 times over the course of 2 hours and then take a long 20 to 30 minute break before starting again.

This project was to develop a Timer Program that could run in the background to pop up and let you know when it was time to take your breaks. This program tested my intro knowledge of the Tkinder GUI module, as well as working with time. By far the most difficult project up to this point, turns out making timers, countdowns, and clocks from scratch are annoying. 

Feel free to use the code to make your own Pomodoro Clock. Since I've been using this applet I've found staying focus has been a lot easier.
